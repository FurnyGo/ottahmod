### OttahMod
This is one of my first Minecraft mods that I have developed. I wanted to add otters to the game after watching Minecraft's recent "Minecraft Live", where they announced otters for Minecraft Dungeons.

The reason why I named the mod "OttahMod" instead of "OtterMod" is because I like to say "Ottah". It just sounds cool ðŸ˜Ž.


#### Development
I am developing the mod for the current Minecraft version, 1.19.2. I plan on updating it as I go.

#### Texture / Model
The texture and model was designed by [Jiingy](https://twitter.com/JingyBM)!
